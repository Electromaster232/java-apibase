# java-flasklike
A "Flask-like" webserver base for Java using the Javalin library. Allows you to use annotations to define routes and their parameters.

This code was originally written for Raisable but is republished in a reduced, unupdated, unmaintained version here for reference purposes.
Much of this code is extremely old and not production grade (and is not in use within the proper Raisable application), but provides a look at the way this can be achieved in Javalin.

Code quality is most definitely not guaranteed!
